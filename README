spash - basic 2D shape overlap library
======================================

Requirements
------------

- Java 5 or higher

License
-------

Most of the code is under the MIT license - see LICENSE.  The parts under other
licenses (BSD) or by other people have license blocks at the top of the relevant
source files.

Usage in a nutshell
-------------------

1. extend org.spash.DefaultBody or implement org.spash.Body
2. create a Space with a BroadPhase and a BodyOverlapper
3. (optional) add OverlapListeners to Space
4. (optional) add PairFilters to Space
5. add Bodies to Space
6. call Space#processOverlaps
7. clear Space
8. repeat 5-7
